# ImagesToPDF
A small and simple script to convert a set of images to a pdf file

# Examples
You can find the attached python script `img2pdf.py`
Let's say you have a bunch of images in `/home/user/Pictures/lecture-slides/` and you want to generate a pdf out of these files say `/home/user/Documents/lecture-slides/slides.pdf` then you can run the script as follows:
`python3 img2pdf.py /home/user/Pictures/lecture-slides/ /home/user/Documents/lecture-slides/slides.pdf` or
`./img2pdf.py /home/user/Pictures/lecture-slides/ /home/user/Documents/lecture-slides/slides.pdf`
Make sure to give execution permission to script. You can do this using the command `sudo chmod +x img2pdf.py`

# Advanced Options
In case if you want to restrict only some of the images to be a part of pdf e.g. `*.jpg` and `.*png` only then you can edit the script to just keep those extensions
